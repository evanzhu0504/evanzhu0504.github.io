    <title>School Networking</title>
    <url>/School-Networking/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This post is a view of my own on the school networking infrastructure and some own understanding and knowledge</p>
<h3 id="School-networking-capabilities"><a href="#School-networking-capabilities" class="headerlink" title="School networking capabilities"></a>School networking capabilities</h3><ul>
<li>Anti DDOS</li>
<li>Firewall protection against viruses </li>
<li>Cached content for educational purposes</li>
<li>Virtual machine access for easy program utilization (<a href="https://rds.bbis.de/rdweb/webclient/">https://rds.bbis.de/rdweb/webclient/</a>)</li>
<li>Web filters against blackmail etc.</li>
<li>Large network coverage, averaging 90mbps per client, I don’t know how many clients are there but that’s a lot of bandwidth</li>
<li>Many others to be discovered</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Basic-client-handshake"><a href="#Basic-client-handshake" class="headerlink" title="Basic client handshake"></a>Basic client handshake</h3><p>Believe it or not, any device that has internet connection is required to have a name. For example, “Lukas Macbook Pro,” this is often defaulted by the Operating System<br>of your device. This applies to any smart device — for example, those lights that can be remote controlled might have a name of “Light bulb1,”<br>you might have a fridge that can be monitored when you are out on a holiday, its name might be “Kitchen fridge.” These names might sound like<br>nothing, but it serves as an identity tag in a lot of situations when it’s communicating with something else, not limited to internet connection,<br>any NFC, bluetooth, radio connection. Basically, one of the clients initiates a handshake, stating: “Hi, I am Evan Laptop, I would like to connect<br>with you, what is your name?” and the other client might refuse the connection based on firewall policies etc., otherwise it will report back: “Hi Evan laptop<br>I would love to connect with you, my name is Lukas laptop!” Then the connection is established, then the two clients start sending data packs to each other, there is little difference between various connection methods,<br>but the framework is basically the same. </p>
<p>Now we have covered the basics of communication between two smart devices, let’s simulate what is going to happen when you connect to the school network.<br>As you are the one, trying to establish a connection to your nearest Access point, you start off by saying your name, “Hey Access point, I am Evan’s laptop,<br>I would like to connect to you and obtain internet connection from you.” Unless there is some mysterious firewall policy that is stopping the access<br>point from offering you connection, you the client should get a reply from the access point asking for authentication, depending on the method WPA, WPA2 etc. You should be<br>asked for a proof of identity to prove that you have the necessary access to access the internet from this network, I am assuming<br>you have the correct password here, you sent that info as a data pack to the access point, and the authentication script will read the words<br>you sent and interpret it as correct or not. After you have established connection to the network, a lot of things have passed during this simple process. </p>
<p>Modern network infrastructure is not advanced enough to just recognize you as plain text such as “Evan laptop”, you might have heard about the term “binary”<br>as in 100110101, this is often interpreted as “The language of computers,” Well that is only half true now days, computing power has increased exponentially<br>since the first computer was invented. Now days, many other formats of things can be understood computers such as hex and decimals. There are a few standards<br>to numbers used in networking. First of all, how do other things recognize you on the internet? The second you establish connection with the access point,<br>you are assigned an IP address, a MAC address and a few other parameters including your plain text name “Evan laptop” This is mostly conducted by an automated<br>process known as DHCP nowadays, it can avoid conflict in one network and other really nice to have features for easy management, notice that an IP address and<br>a MAC address cannot be repeated in the same network, so imagine having to assign everything that connects to the network an IP address and a MAC address, that’s<br>a nightmare! So DHCP is the industrial standard now for assigning parameters to clients. </p>
<p>Numbers are also way easier to read than words, such as 24 and twenty-four, for both humans and machines, so that’s why most programming language does not accept<br>plain text numbers. Numbers are also faster to index and to search, all the clients are stored like a library in the memory of the network; it got to be organized<br>somehow, right? Since 1 &lt; 2 is much faster than one &lt; two for machines, why not? </p>
<h3 id="How-does-the-school-see-what-you-are-up-to"><a href="#How-does-the-school-see-what-you-are-up-to" class="headerlink" title="How does the school see what you are up to?"></a>How does the school see what you are up to?</h3><p>IP address not only applies to clients, it also applies to websites, this is what a DNS server does, future article on that, but it basically translates, for example,<br>“Google.com” in to an address that can be used to reach the actual Google server. That process is being captured by the school firewall constantly as is linked to your<br>IP address of your own device. You can use a VPN service to encrypt this entire process, but I’m afraid that no method will completely hide your internet traffic from<br>the school firewall or any firewall including the ones in your house. Since the data packs between you and the website is constantly monitored and captured by your router<br>and&#x2F;or the firewall for the network. </p>
